## Descriptions of Thesis

This project will look at using modern sensors like mmWave radar to enhance road infrastructure by providing a complete situational awareness. The mmWave radar uses high frequencies around 80 GHz, and provides precise positioning information in both distance as well as some angular resolution. It has recently become low in cost, due to its prolific use in modern vehicles. The limitations with this radar is only its range, which is limited to around 100 m.
